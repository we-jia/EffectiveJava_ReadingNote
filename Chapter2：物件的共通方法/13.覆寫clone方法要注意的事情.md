### 覆寫clone方法要注意的事情

這個Item讀完後大概可以理解，但要記錄下來其實有點困難，直接看code或許會夠好懂，首先先看到`Cloneable`介面，這個介面很特別，他並沒有提供任何的規範讓人去覆寫，因此直接看註解：

``` Java
/**
 * A class implements the <code>Cloneable</code> interface to
 * indicate to the {@link java.lang.Object#clone()} method that it
 * is legal for that method to make a
 * field-for-field copy of instances of that class.
 * <p>
 * Invoking Object's clone method on an instance that does not implement the
 * <code>Cloneable</code> interface results in the exception
 * <code>CloneNotSupportedException</code> being thrown.
 * <p>
 * By convention, classes that implement this interface should override
 * {@code Object.clone} (which is protected) with a public method.
 * See {@link java.lang.Object#clone()} for details on overriding this
 * method.
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface does <i>not</i> contain the {@code clone} method.
 * Therefore, it is not possible to clone an object merely by virtue of the
 * fact that it implements this interface.  Even if the clone method is invoked
 * reflectively, there is no guarantee that it will succeed.
 *
 * @author  unascribed
 * @see     java.lang.CloneNotSupportedException
 * @see     java.lang.Object#clone()
 * @since   1.0
 */
public interface Cloneable {
}
```

大意是，如果今天想要使用`Object.clone(..)`這個方法時，就要讓物件去實做這個介面，並且覆寫`Object.clone(..)`方法，這邊來看到這個方法的註解：

``` Java
    /**
     * Creates and returns a copy of this object.  The precise meaning
     * of "copy" may depend on the class of the object. The general
     * intent is that, for any object {@code x}, the expression:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone() != x</pre></blockquote>
     * will be true, and that the expression:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</pre></blockquote>
     * will be {@code true}, but these are not absolute requirements.
     * While it is typically the case that:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().equals(x)</pre></blockquote>
     * will be {@code true}, this is not an absolute requirement.
     * <p>
     * By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
     * {@code super.clone}.  If a class and all of its superclasses (except
     * {@code Object}) obey this convention, it will be the case that
     * {@code x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()}.
     * <p>
     * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
     * of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
     * it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
     * by {@code super.clone} before returning it.  Typically, this means
     * copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
     * of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
     * objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
     * primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
     * the case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone}
     * need to be modified.
     * <p>
     * The method {@code clone} for class {@code Object} performs a
     * specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
     * not implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a
     * {@code CloneNotSupportedException} is thrown. Note that all arrays
     * are considered to implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and that
     * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
     * is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.
     * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
     * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
     * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
     * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
     * performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
     * <p>
     * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
     * {@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object
     * whose class is {@code Object} will result in throwing an
     * exception at run time.
     *
     * @return     a clone of this instance.
     * @throws  CloneNotSupportedException  if the object's class does not
     *               support the {@code Cloneable} interface. Subclasses
     *               that override the {@code clone} method can also
     *               throw this exception to indicate that an instance cannot
     *               be cloned.
     * @see java.lang.Cloneable
     */
    @HotSpotIntrinsicCandidate
    protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException;
```

會看到個一個`native`的標記，表示這段程式碼是不給看實做的，一樣是去看註解，這邊有提到幾個覆寫`Cloneable`介面需要注意的事情：

1. `x.clone() != x`要為true。
2. `x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()`如果能的話，盡量為true。
3. `x.clone().equals(x)`如果能的話，盡量為true。

也有提到，如果今天呼叫的物件，並沒有覆寫`Cloneable`介面，直接呼叫`clone(..)`方法，這時JVM就會拋出Exception。另一個提到的重點是他只會做到shallow copy而不是deep copy。最後來看看Java內部物件的範例（這邊是找`ArrayList`來使用）：

``` Java
/**
* Returns a shallow copy of this {@code ArrayList} instance.  (The
* elements themselves are not copied.)
*
* @return a clone of this {@code ArrayList} instance
*/
public Object clone() {
    try {
        ArrayList<?> v = (ArrayList<?>) super.clone();
        v.elementData = Arrays.copyOf(elementData, size);
        v.modCount = 0;
        return v;
    } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
        // this shouldn't happen, since we are Cloneable
        throw new InternalError(e);
    }
}
```

除此之外，作者還有提到其他可能會引發的問題，因此比起把這些複雜的東西帶入到程式碼，作者其實更傾向用建構子或是靜態工廠方法來取代這種`clone(..)`的作法：

``` Java
// Copy constructor
public Yum(Yum yum) { ... };

// Copy factory
public static Yum newInstance(Yum yum) { ... };
```
